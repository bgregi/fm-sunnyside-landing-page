## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This challenge was pretty straightforward for me, because I used all the same techniques I've used in the previous challenges, except for CSS Grid, which I've used for the first time here in a section in the mobile layout. It was a good challenge overall, but a bit long and with some small details, which helped to tested my patience a little bit. I'm looking forward to more advanced challenges.


### Useful resources

- [Element: mouseover event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event) - This helped me in coding the active states for the social media icons.
